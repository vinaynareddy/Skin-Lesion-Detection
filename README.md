# Skin-Lesion-Detection

This thesis focuses on the problem of automatic skin lesion detection, particularly on melanoma detection, by 
applying semantic segmentation and classification from dermoscopic images using a deep learning based 
approach. For the first problem, a U-Net convolutional neural network architecture is applied for an accurate 
extraction of the lesion region .For the second problem, the current model performs a binary classification (benign 
versus malignant) that can be used for narly melanoma detection. The proposed solution is built around the VGGNet Conv Net architecture and uses the transfer learning paradigm. This work performs a comparative evaluation 
of classification alone (using the entire image) against a combination of the two approaches in order to assess 
which of them achieves better classification results. The model is general enough to be extended to multi-class 
skin lesion classification
